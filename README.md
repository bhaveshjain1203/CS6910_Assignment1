# Below are the details of file present in the root directory: 

# 1. DL_Question1.ipynb :
Google Colab implementation of Question 1

# 2. DL_Question2.ipynb:
Google Colab implementation of Question 2

# 3. Q1.py :
Python code for Question 1

# 4. Q2.py : 
Python code for Question 2

# 5. Q3.py :
Temporary implementation of Question 3 which is later added to Wandb.py file

# 6. Wandb.py :
To run this file first use the (7.) sweep.config file to create sweep in Wandb (update the file name to Wandb.py), copy the sweep link generated by wandb in command prompt

# 7. sweep.config : 
To be copied while creating the sweep from wandb

# 8. train.py : 
Contains argparse implementation of the above file by commenting out the parameters that it is accepting from sweep.config file.

# 9. Question10.ipynb : 
Google Colab implementation of Question 10
